            <p>Wild Life includes all non-domesticated plants, animals and other organisms.</p>
            <p>Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rain forests, plains, grasslands, and other
                areas including the most developed urban sites, all have distinct forms of wildlife.</p><br>

                <p>Exploitation of wild populations has been a characteristic of modern man since our exodus from
                    Africa
                    130,000 â€“ 70,000 years ago. The rate of extinctions of entire species of plants and animals across
                    the
                    planet has been so high in the last few hundred years it is widely believed that we are in the
                    sixth
                    great extinction event on this planet</p><br>

            <h3>Food, pets, and traditional medicines</h3><br>
            <p>Anthropologists believe that the Stone Age people and hunter-gatherers relied on wildlife, both plants
                and animals, for their food. In fact, some species may have been hunted to extinction by early human
                hunters.</p>
